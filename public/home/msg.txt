Welcome to the website for our 2020 music composition class! This semester, I was so impressed and inspired by the music students were composing, that I encouraged them to share their work with the school on a website, and this is the fruit of their efforts. Special thanks to Steven Lu and Daniel Cao for putting together the website. Please enjoy the wonderful music created by PRISMS students this term!
