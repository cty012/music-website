This document will show you how to set up the website.

There are two folders that you will be operating in.
    home: Defines the contents of the home page.
    music: Contains and arranges all music files and description files that will be displayed on the website.

Procedure:
1. Put all music files and description files in the music folder and arrange them properly. (More detailed instructions: ./more/how to arrange music files.txt)
    (I already put mine in the music folder and they are properly arranged. Just do the same with the rest.)
2. Add the contents in the home page. (More detailed instructions: ./more/how to change home content.txt)
3. (OPTIONAL) Preview the website locally. (More detailed instructions: ./more/how to preview the website locally before deploying.txt)
4. Deploy the website online (More detailed instructions: ./more/how to deploy the website onto the Internet.txt)

How to update the website depends on the host you are using for deploying the website (step 4).
Usually, you just need to change the contents and then repeat step 4.

Contact Daniel if you have any question.
