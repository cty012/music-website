How to Preview the Website Locally Before Deploying

This is useful because you can check if everything works properly before deploying it for everyone to see.
However, it is NOT RECOMMENDED, because you need to install node.js first.

1. How to install node.js:
(1) Go to nodejs.org and download the version that matches your operating system
(2) Follow the instructions of installing

2. How to start the local server:
(1) Open the command line (Command Prompt for Win10 and Terminal for Mac)
(2) Navigate into the project folder (music-website)
(3) Type: npm start
(4) Go to a reliable browser (Chrome, Firefox, definitely not IE) and type: localhost:8080
Now you should be able to see the website.

3. Contact Daniel if you have any question.
