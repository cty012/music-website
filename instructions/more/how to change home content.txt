How to Change Home Content:

The contents of the "Home" tab is located in the txt file under the path: home/msg.txt

The format of this text file is DIFFERENT from the format of description files.
When the home content is displayed on a website:
(1) The server reads the contents of the "msg.txt" file and saves it as a string.
(2) The server then removes blank spaces and line breaks at the beginning and end of the string.
(3) Finally, the string is sent to the browser and displayed as a string.

Therefore, when writing the msg.txt file:
(1) One paragraph should be in one line.
(2) There can be multiple line breaks between paragraphs.
(3) Using another editor to write the contents is highly recommended. After that paste the contents into the msg.txt file.
