How to Arrange Music Files:

1. Arrangement of music files and description files:
All music files should be put in the "music" folder under the project folder, which is the folder I sent to you.

The path of any music file should look like this:
Music file:
    music/[year]/[composer]/[index]_[music-name]/[music-name].mp3
Description file:
    music/[year]/[composer]/[index]_[music-name]/description.txt

[year]: 4 numbers that represent the year of the class. (e.g. 2020)
[composer]: Name of the composer of the music. (e.g. Daniel, daniel, Daniel Cao)
    Format doesn't matter as long as it identifies students, but don't make it too long.
[index]: Defines the order it will be displayed on the website. (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 10, 11)
    Important: Start from 1! Don't skip any number!
    The [index] will not be displayed on the website. It is only for sorting the music in order.
[music-name]: Full name of the music.

2. How to add description:
When a description is displayed on a website:
(1) The server reads the contents of the "description.txt" file and saves it as a string.
(2) The server then removes blank spaces and line breaks at the beginning and end of the string.
(3) Then, all line breaks in the middle will be turned into blank spaces.
(4) Finally, the string is sent to the browser and displayed as a string in ONE line.

Therefore, feel free to add line breaks in the middle of the description, since they will all become blank spaces.
Also, don't make it too long so that it fits the space given in the html file.

3. Contact Daniel if you have any question or want to change anything above.
